# The-College-Project
The College Project is a book in the making that will be comprised of personal accounts of discrimination on college campuses across the country.  The website introduces this project, gives background on prominent forms of discrimination on college campuses, provides a list of organizations to donate to, and allows you to contribute your own story to the project.
